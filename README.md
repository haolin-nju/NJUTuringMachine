# Toy Turing Machine

## Description
This project is a toy turing machine developed for the graduate course **"Introduction to Computational Theory" of the Department of Computer Science of Nanjing University**. Give it a try!

## Instructions
Run 'main.py' and you can see the following output at the command line:

```shell
1: 0 1 1 1 1 0 
     ^         
1: 0 0 1 1 1 0 
       ^       
1: 0 0 0 1 1 0 
         ^     
1: 0 0 0 0 1 0 
           ^   
1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 
             ^ 
2: 0 0 0 0 0 1 
             ^ 
Output = 0 
```

Congratulations! This is a zero-function turing machine! In addition to the zero-function turing machine, I have predefined some other turing machine models in the 'models.py' that you can use directly.

You can also define some turing machines yourself. Have fun!
